Flow Control:
Ex 1: Write a method that calculates the factorial of integer n( returns 1*2*â€¦*n).
Ex 2: Write a method that calculates the nth factorial number( f0 = 0, f1= 1, fn = fn-1 + fn-2).
Ex 3: Write a method that return true if an integer n is a prime number.
Ex 4: Write a method that receives a char array and returns true if it represents a palindrome.
